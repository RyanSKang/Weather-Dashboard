## Description


Creating a Weather Dashboard was very challenging. I had a lot of trouble understanding fetch and utilizing API's, but this challenge really forced me to learn and navigate my API's to display the data I wanted. The main goal for the Weather Dashboard was to use a WeatherAPI and a GeoLocation API cohesively so that we can extract data and display it to our webapplication in our own way. I wanted to build this project so I can practice using JavaScript in creative ways. This was the first project that I did not use any Youtube Tutorials to really challenge myself and to see what I truly understood from this course. I learned how to pass functions and values into other functions so that my API's can work together to provide the necessary information of my web application. It allows the user to type in any city and it will display the weather forecast for said city within a 5-day forecast. I never really thought I would use the application/network tool within my inspect tool, but I realized that it is imperative to know where my coding went wrong and why it is not retrieving what is intended. This project also forced me into the habit of console logging out everything because the main goal is to write little code as possible to see if it works in the first place. I initially had the problem of writing my code and debugging line by line because I was not have in the habit of console logging, but this project made me realize the importance of such habits.

## Usage


This application is a simple tool that allows the user to type a city within the text area in order to see the 5-day weather forecast. It will save the previous search history as a button that will direct you back to the weather forecast of that city.
